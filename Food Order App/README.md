In this project I make a dummy back-end for using in the front-end. Food Order App which includes, useReducer, ContextAPI, Modal like this important concepts...

If you want to try this project you should run the back-end first after that run the front-end..

For both you should first npm install,

After,
back-end: npm start
front-end: npm run dev

That's it ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘½
